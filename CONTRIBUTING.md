# CONTRIBUTING

We're accepting help from anyone! This repo is collaborative, so if you want to add a solution in a new language (check Wikipedia [Programming Language List](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_programming_languages)) or just improve some code that you think that can be improved, follow this steps:


## 1. Fork it :fork_and_knife:

You can get your own fork/copy of [Gulag Sort](https://github.com/samvelbd/gulag-sort/) by using the <kbd><b>Fork</b></kbd></a> button above.

## 2. Start coding! :rabbit2:

Once you have forked the repo, add your program in the language folder in main branch, if there is no language folder, make one, then add into it.

For a PR to be approved and merged please note:

- We allow more than one solution for one language, so if you don't want to modify someone else's code, you can add a new file with your own solution. Have in mind that your solution must be completely unique, if it isn't consider modifying the existing code.
- We don't allow deletions of others files or code.
- We don't allow files to be directly added in root directory of project, add them in their language folder
- Follow the code specifications!

### Code specifications

For the purpuses of this repo, we defined some rules that your code must to follow, this rules are listed bellow:
1. Your file **must** be named **stalin-sort**. All the other files of the same language must be at its title the implementation expecificaiton. For example the C++ folder have the *stalin-sort.cpp* and the *stalin-sort-compile-time.cpp* that runs at compile time, just as said at its name. 
2. Your file **must** have **ONE** function called Stalin Sort, for pattern matters it can be named according to the language case, so if it's PascalCase the function name is StalinSort, if it's camelCase the function name is stalinSort and so on. Take note that the language case must be followed through all code.
3. For this repo, we're implementing the ordering of **INTEGERS**, so case the language that you're implementing is static typed have it in mind. Additionally, you could implement the ordering of other types, but the focus here is on integers.
4. This rules are flexible case the language has some particularity like brainf*ck. So if the language can't follow one of this rules make it clear at the PR and we'll analyze each particularity.

## 3. Ready, Steady, Go... :turtle: :rabbit2:
